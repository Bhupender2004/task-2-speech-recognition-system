# Speech Recognition System
## Overview
This Speech Recognition System allows users to convert spoken language into text. It uses
advanced machine learning techniques, including neural networks and natural language processing
(NLP), to transcribe spoken words with high accuracy.
## Features
- Real-time transcription of speech to text
- Support for multiple languages
- Handles various accents and background noise
- Customizable models for specific domains (e.g., medical, legal)
## Requirements
Before running the system, make sure the following software and libraries are installed:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
- `speech_recognition`
- `pyaudio`
- `numpy`
- `tensorflow` (if using deep learning models)
- `librosa` (for audio processing)
You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install speechrecognition pyaudio numpy tensorflow librosa
```
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bhupender2004/task-2-speech-recognition-system/blob/main/speech_recognition_gui.py
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd speech-recognition-system
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
To use the speech recognition system, run the following command:
```bash
python recognize.py
```
This will prompt you to speak, and the system will transcribe your speech into text in real-time.
### Command-Line Arguments
- `--language` : Specify the language for speech recognition (default: English).
- `--model` : Choose the model for recognition (e.g., `default`, `medical`, etc.).
Example:
```bash
python recognize.py --language "en-US" --model "default"
```
## Models
The system comes with pre-trained models optimized for general speech, but you can train your
own models for specific use cases by following the instructions in the "Training" section below.
## Training
If you wish to train your own model, you will need a large dataset of speech-to-text pairs. Follow the
steps below to train the model:
1. Prepare your dataset in the appropriate format.
2. Run the training script:
```bash
python train_model.py --data path_to_data
```
3. Once the training is complete, save the model weights and specify them in the `recognize.py`
script.
